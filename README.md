Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio, a realm where data comes to life and stories are told through patterns, insights, and revelations. In this collection of projects, I've harnessed the power of key data analysis techniques to explore the intricacies of datasets, uncover hidden gems of information, and present narratives that resonate.

From the art of data cleansing, where noise gives way to clarity, to the symphony of exploratory data analysis, where trends and anomalies harmonize, this portfolio reflects my dedication to mastering the techniques that underpin every successful analysis.

### Project 1: Shopzone Sales 2023

Problem/Goals: The company wants to gain insights into their sales performance for the year and understand what categories customers are buying more of, and breakdown of sales by gender. Also, during which quarters of the year is there more traffic in the store and to explore whether there are any age differences among their customers that might influence purchasing patterns.

### Project 3: Birth Rates, Life Expectancy, and Death Rates Analysis

Problem/Goals: The goal in this project is to analyze and address whether birth rates, fertility rates are in decline, and how do they compare with death rates in the last 100 years and to see if this trend is continuing. Combine multiple datasets together and clean it using SQL, then visualize the trends on Tableau.
