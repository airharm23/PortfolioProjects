### Project 1: Federal Reserve Total Assets + Top Companies Total Assets Growth Rate Effect on Stock Market

Problem/Goals: Web scraping to see how total assets of big banks can be used to predict future stock market price movement. I scraped data using Python, then extracted the data to SQL where I joined all the datasets/csv files together. I also calculated the YoY % Change using windows functions. Finally, i extracted the data onto Tableau where I found some insights about stock market price movement shown in images below.
